I originally developed it for my own personal usage, but Jasper Campbell (@tuck3r) convinced me to share it, so here it is. I decided to publish it on the Chrome Web Store for free for others to use. I know people can be fickle, so if you use it please leave a nice review and rating. Usually people only bother to review things they dislike and that is discouraging to the developer(s) and potential users. Your positive review would mean a lot. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nChrome extension to hide all images by default and show images again with click of icon. When in hide mode, hover your cursor over an image to view it temporarily.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress and a hobby project. It is intended to be simple.\r\n\r\n### What does it do?\r\n\r\n- Hides all images by default. Note: there is a short delay as it waits for the page to load before hiding them. This needs work.\r\n\r\n- When images are hidden, you can mouse-over them to show them temporarily.\r\n\r\n- Shows all images again when you click the icon. Note: it will toggle them on/off with each click.\r\n\r\n- Uses HTML5 local storage to keep track of the image hide status (based on icon clicks).\r\n\r\n- Show/Hide toggling is remembered on a per-domain basis. (This means you can hide images on one site and show them on a different site and it will not conflict.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What doesn't it do?\r\n\r\n- It does not **block** images and does not save you data.\r\n\r\n- It does not (yet) hide background images, videos, or other media. (Working on it)\r\n\r\n- It does not make you a sandwich (even if you use sudo).\r\n\r\n- It does not cost you money.\r\n\r\n- It does not make you money.\r\n\r\n- It does not track, store, share, or otherwise use any of your information.\r\n\r\n- It does not do anything other than what is listed in the \"What does it do?\" section above.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis is released under the MIT license.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDeveloped by Alex Mason (@alexmason81).\r\nIcon provided by Jake Farr.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease report any bugs with this extension or feature requests here: [Issues and/or Feature Requests](https://github.com/alexmason81/ChromeImgHider/issues) \r\n","google":"UA-71000227-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
