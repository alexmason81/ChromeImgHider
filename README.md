# ImgHider

#### Description

Chrome extension to hide all images by default and show images again with click of icon.

#### Features

- Hides all images by default. Note: there is a short delay as it waits for the page to load before hiding them. This needs work.

- Shows all images again when you click the icon. Note: it will toggle them on/off with each click.

- Uses HTML5 local storage to keep track of the image hide status (based on icon clicks).

- When images are hidden, you can mouse-over them to show them temporarily.

#### License

This is released under the MIT license.

#### Libraries

It currently depends on the jQuery 2.14 library (included) which is also under the MIT license.

#### Instructions

This is an unpublished Chrome extension. Follow the guide here to install: [Load the extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

#### Forks, Bugs, Publishing, and etc.

- If you like this extension and want to contribute to it, feel free. I would like to request that you make a pull request with any changes as I'd like to see what other people come up in improving it.

- If you come across any bugs please report them here and I'll see what I can do.

- If you use this code and make something awesome that you want to publish on Google Play or whatever, that's cool. Just please give me a virtual nod (link to this repo and/or website), if you don't mind.

#### Disclaimer

I made this extension in about 5 minutes (I think I spent more time on this readme than the actual code). Quick and dirty. I did it because I wanted to be able to view articles without all the images, unless I chose to see the images. This is certainly a work in progress. I did not publish it because it is so raw, but I figured someone might be interested in it, and perhaps even contribute to it.

#### Future Changes (wish list?)

- Change it to use straight JavaScript (remove jQuery dependency).

- Change it to hide images without waiting for page load (if possible).

- Include background/css images in the show/hide.

- Open to suggestions...
